Mutable Types:
• Mutable types are types whose instances can be
modified after they are created.
• Characteristics: Properties or fields of a mutable
type can be changed.
• Changes to an instance affect the state of that
instance.
• Examples include classes, arrays, and custom objects
where properties can be modified.





Immutable Types:
• Immutable types are types whose instances cannot
be modified after they are created.
• Characteristics: Properties or fields of an immutable
type cannot be changed after the instance is created.
• Any operation that appears to modify the instance
actually returns a new instance with the desired
changes.
• Examples include strings, tuples, and some built-in
value types.
• Another Example a Person Class that has everything as
ready only.






Pros and Cons:
Mutable Types:
• Pros:
• More flexible for certain scenarios.
• Can be more memory-efficient if state changes frequently.
• Cons:
• Prone to unintended side effects.
• May require additional effort to maintain consistency.
Immutable Types:
• Pros:
• Safer and less error-prone since instances cannot be modified.
• Easier to reason about and maintain.
• Cons:
• Creating a new instance for each modification
• Can be less memory-efficient for certain scenarios.
